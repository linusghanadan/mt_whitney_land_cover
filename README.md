# Land Cover Analysis around Mount Whitney
This analysis uses Python to extract land cover statistics from a USGS raster dataset on land cover classification in the area surrounding Mount Whitney in California. I also create a simple map showing the area of analysis relative to Mount Whitney. An analysis of this kind has potential use for government agencies seeking to better understand land cover in a region.

Datasets:
- USGS land cover raster dataset
- USGS land cover tabular dataset
- Shapefile of California geographic boundaries
